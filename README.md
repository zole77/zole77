- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in graduation
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning andorid with java
- ðŸŒˆ I'm working on a 365-grass project.
- An application for COIVD-19 is being developed as a graduation work.
- The name of the app is Corona Allimi
- I will be moving my graduation Android project into my project and working on both the front end and the back end.



# What is the 365-grass project?
- 365-grass is a daily upload of anything related to coding to github. 
- I set this as my goal for the year 2021.
- Upload anything related to coding, access Git Hub once a day
- I have been working on this project since Jan 19th.
